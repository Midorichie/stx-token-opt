# Optimized STX Token

## Overview

This project implements an optimized STX token contract on the Stacks blockchain, focusing on reduced latency, increased throughput, and enhanced functionality. The contract is written in Clarity and complies with the SIP-010 fungible token standard.

## Features

1. **SIP-010 Compliance**: Ensures compatibility with the Stacks ecosystem.
2. **Optimized Batch Transfers**: Process multiple transfers in a single transaction.
3. **Time-Locked Transfers**: Create transfers that can only be released after a specified block height.
4. **Allowances and Approved Transfers**: Enable delegated spending of tokens.
5. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Specific error codes for better debugging and user feedback.
6. **Event Logging**: Comprehensive logging of important token operations.
7. **Optimized Total Supply Tracking**: Efficient tracking of the token's total supply.

## Contract Functions

### Read-Only Functions

- `get-name`: Returns the token name.
- `get-symbol`: Returns the token symbol.
- `get-decimals`: Returns the number of decimal places.
- `get-balance`: Returns the balance of a given account.
- `get-total-supply`: Returns the total supply of tokens.
- `get-token-uri`: Returns the token's metadata URI.

### Public Functions

- `transfer`: Transfer tokens between accounts.
- `mint`: Mint new tokens (restricted to contract owner).
- `batch-transfer`: Process multiple transfers in one transaction.
- `create-time-lock`: Create a time-locked transfer.
- `release-time-lock`: Release tokens from a time-lock after the unlock height.
- `set-allowance`: Set an allowance for a spender.
- `transfer-from`: Transfer tokens on behalf of another account (within allowance).

## Deployment

To deploy this contract on the Stacks blockchain:

1. Ensure you have the Stacks CLI installed and configured.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/optimized-stx-token.git
   cd optimized-stx-token
   ```
3. Deploy the contract:
   ```
   stx deploy token-optimization-v2.clar --network mainnet
   ```

Replace `mainnet` with `testnet` for testnet deployment.

## Usage

After deployment, you can interact with the contract using the Stacks CLI or integrate it into your dApp using the Stacks.js library.

Example of transferring tokens:

```javascript
import { callReadOnlyFunction, callContractFunction } from '@stacks/transactions';

// Transfer tokens
const transferTokens = async (amount, recipient) => {
  const txOptions = {
    contractAddress: 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM',
    contractName: 'token-optimization-v2',
    functionName: 'transfer',
    functionArgs: [amount, recipient],
    senderAddress: 'ST2CY5V39NHDPWSXMW9QDT3HC3GD6Q6XX4CFRK9AG',
    network: 'mainnet',
  };
  
  const transaction = await callContractFunction(txOptions);
  return transaction;
};
```

## Security Considerations

- Conduct a thorough security audit before mainnet deployment.
- Carefully manage the contract owner's private key.
- Monitor the contract for any unusual activity.

## Performance Optimizations

This contract includes several optimizations to reduce latency and increase throughput:

- Batch processing of transfers
- Efficient data structures for balance and allowance tracking
- Optimized total supply calculation
